We are excited to share the new release of Dapr v0.11.0! This is another key release on the path of getting Dapr production ready and as you see below, includes features and additions to help secure and configure Dapr enabled applications. This blog post will cover the highlights of the new features and enhancements in Dapr v0.11.0. 

As with any Dapr release, it is recommended to review the official [release notes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v0.11.0) and especially the list of [breaking changes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v0.11.0#breaking-changes) introduced in each release.

We'd like to thank our amazing engaged community for all of the collaboration around making this release possible through feature requests, feedback on proposals and of course, code contribution to the Dapr project. Thank you!

## Release highlights

### Declarative topic subscriptions for pub/sub

This is feature has been requested by the community as part of the additional ways to define topic subscriptions for the pub/sub building block. With [declarative topic subscriptions](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/howto/consume-topic/README.md#declarative-subscriptions), users can now define subscriptions to topics using "configuration as code" in YAML files. This capability allows for changing subscriptions Dapr is managing for an application without changing application code.

### Service invocation across namespaces

Dapr namespaces allow users to create groupings of services to better manage their distributed applications. A key capability the we've been hearing from the community, is the ability for service invocation to be enabled across different namespaces. Prior to this release, the name resolution of services was limited to the boundaries of the namespace. With [this enhancement](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/concepts/service-invocation#namespaces-scoping) added in Dapr v0.11, services can now explicitly invoke methods on services in a different namespace.

### Access control lists for service invocation

Once of the key areas of focus of Dapr is providing users the infrastructure to secure their applications. In the context of service invocation is having granular control over which service can invoke methods in another service. This control can now be achieved by defining [access control lists](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/concepts/service-invocation#service-access-security) as part of the Dapr [configuration](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/concepts/configuration/README.md) definitions.

### Scoping for secrets

Another capability aimed at providing more ways to harden application security, focuses on secret access. As part of the secret API of Dapr, users can now define [secret scopes](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/howto/secrets-scopes/README.md) which provide granular control on sensitive secrets that can be accessed through the API. With a combination of default allow or deny behavior and the ability to specifically define allowed and denied secrets for access, users now have a lot of flexibility to put in place a secret access policy of their choosing.

## New components

### Binding

- RethinkDB binding
- Bi-directional PostgreSQL


### Middleware

- [Open policy agent](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/howto/policies-with-opa/README.md)

## Other updates

We recently announced the [integration of Dapr with Azure API Management](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2020/09/22/announcing-dapr-integration-azure-api-management-service-apim/) and so far we have seen a lot of great feedback on this latest integration. See [this sample](https://github.com/dapr/samples/tree/master/dapr-apim-integration) if you would like to try it yourself.
