Dapr has now been out for one year and in that time, we have received a tremendous amount of feedback, engagement, and contributions from developers that have been critical to its adoption and continued improvement. After 11 releases we are now putting Dapr on a path to a stable v1.0 release, meaning it can be used in production deployments. A v1.0 release also means that future breaking changes go through controlled versioning processes to not break already deployed applications.  A primary indicator for the readiness of a v1.0 release has been its ongoing use in production deployments. We have been working with several companies over the last year who are already deploying their applications with Dapr in production and their feedback has been essential to Dapr reaching this milestone.

Our goal is to have the first v1.0 release candidate (RC) available in Nov 2020 and then release RC updates with bug fixes and minor feature adds as we get feedback. For example, these will be v1.0.0-rc1, v1.0.0-rc2 etc.  The final v1.0.0 release in 2021, depends on the number of issues that arise and reaching the stated goals in areas such as performance, security, scale and test coverage. Specifically, the v1.0 release is for the dapr, CLI, dotnet-sdk, java-sdk, python-sdk, go-sdk, dashboard and components-contrib repos. For the components-contrib repo, out of the 75+ components today around 15 will be certified for “stable production use”, with the rest remaining in “alpha” status. We will publish the list of these and provide guidance on how you can help expediate getting other alpha components to production status. Dapr is also designed to be hosting platform agnostic, however for the v1.0 release Kubernetes and self hosted on VMs are the two validated platforms for running deployments in production.

Are you interested in helping with the Dapr v1.0 release? Dapr can be used in a broad range of applicatons and one of the best ways to contribute is to build real-world applications that address your needs and provide direct feedback on your experience. We are interested in any issues or inconsistencies you may encounter or providing feedback on the documentation. If you want to jump into the repos and push PRs to fix bugs, provide more testing on your favorite building block or SDK, either as unit tests or end-to-end testing, that would help tremendously. Reading through the docs and finding poorly or undocumented features, inconsistencies and just plain mistakes helps to make Dapr easier for all developers to use. This means that for the next few months the maintainers and approvers will be focused on the RC releases and PRs may take longer to be reviewed as the Dapr community is prioritizing reviews in the previously stated areas.

We are extremely excited that after one year, we are able to outline this path to a Dapr v1.0 stable release to give you the confidence to use Dapr in production deployments, scoped to a set of capabilities which have been driven by the requirements of real world services built with different programming languages. We appreciate your help and your ongoing contributions on this amazing journey together.
