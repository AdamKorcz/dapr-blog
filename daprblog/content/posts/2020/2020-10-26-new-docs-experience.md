Since Dapr was launched a year ago, it has grown at a remarkable pace. With new capabilities, features and enhancements growing, so does the documentation that help developers and operators use Dapr to build their next distributed applications. This includes introductory docs about Dapr concepts, "How-To" guides for achieving specific tasks and API reference documentation that are all a critical part of giving developers the tools they need to take advantage of everything Dapr has to offer. 

Documentation has always been a top-of-mind area for the project and our approach has been that the documentation of a new feature is an integral part of delivering it along with the bits. The growing community around Dapr in the past year has also taken a huge role in improving the docs - from simple fixes to typos and broken links to comprehensive additions to guides, the docs repo has seen the most community contributions of all the Dapr repositories and for that we want to give a big thank you to the community!

As Dapr in on the [path to stable v1.0 release]({{<ref 2020-10-20-path-to-production-release>}}) and seeing as the documentation is growing to point where navigating the GitHub repo is becoming harder and harder we have decided to streamline the docs experience and launch [docs.dapr.io](https://docs.dapr.io)
