In a recent [blog post]({{<ref "2020-10-20-path-to-production-release.md">}}) , we shared that Dapr is on the path towards a v1.0 release and today we are excited to announce that the first release candidate for v1.0 is available. This release candidate marks a significant milestone for Dapr as it has matured to be a solution for developers building distributed applications in a variety of scenarios.

We invite the Dapr community to [install and start using](#installing-and-using-v100-rc1) this release and help us find and fix issues so we can get Dapr further closer to a production ready release. As issues are identified and fixed, we expect to continue and release additional release candidate versions until the official v1.0.0 release.

We are proud of the community that has grown around Dapr since it was first released and of the significant contributions the project has seen from community members along the way. This important step in the maturity of Dapr is an achievement for the entire community and we are thankful for each and every community member who has tried out Dapr, opened issues, submitted pull requests and engaged with us to make it better.

## Installing and using v1.0.0-rc.1

Since this is a release candidate, if you would like to try it out you will have to explicitly opt-in and install it. The instructions to upgrade to the v1.0.0-rc.1 can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/release-1.0/docs/release_notes/v1.0.0-rc.1.md) as well as in the [v1.0.0-rc.1 docs version](https://v1-rc1.docs.dapr.io/getting-started/).

## Release highlights

These are some highlights for this release:

- The [actor placement service](https://v1-rc1.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/actors/actors-background/#actor-placement-service) now has a high availability (HA) configuration to improve resilience and enable upgrades on production system that use actors to minimize downtime on actor instance availability.
- Substantial work has been done on improving the scale and performance of actors.
- [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) is now an [option to capture observability events](https://v1-rc1.docs.dapr.io/operations/monitoring/open-telemetry-collector/) including logs, metrics and tracing .
- The [secrets API](https://v1-rc1.docs.dapr.io/reference/api/secrets_api/) can now be called on the Dapr sidecar before the app has responded on the app-port. This enables the app to do secrets initialization before the app starts, for example setting up JWT validation in an auth pipeline/middleware.
- HTTP endpoints in your app can now be HTTPS endpoints, which previously were blocked. If your app is listening on HTTPS or has a gRPC TLS configuration enabled, use the `app-ssl` flag like this. This will have Dapr invoke the app over an insecure SSL channel.

    ```sh
        dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js --app-ssl
    ```

- Published [service invocation API performance numbers](https://v1-rc1.docs.dapr.io/operations/performance-and-scalability/perf-service-invocation/) for the v0.11.3 release which will be updated with each future release.
- The CLI component command `dapr components -k` now shows version information.
