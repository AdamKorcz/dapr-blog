We're happy to announce that this week, Dapr [joined the CNCF as an Incubating project](placeholder-url).
Ever since its initial launch, the Dapr project has made its intention clear that the project is eventually to be donated to a vendor-neutral foundation. The project [recently formed a Steering and Technical Committee](https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/09/20/announcing-daprs-steering-and-technical-committee/) that re-enforces our commitment to vendor neutrality by ensuring balanced representation in the committee across vendors.

The CNCF is the home for many projects that Dapr integrates with closely. For example, Dapr uses gRPC as its main RPC stack. OpenTelemetry is used as Dapr's telemetry protocol, CloudEvents are used to standardize the message format in Dapr's Pub/Sub API, SPIFFE is used as the identity format for Dapr's access list feature, Prometheus is used as the metrics format for the Dapr endpoints, NATS is a supported Pub/Sub implementation for Dapr as well as Open Policy Agent. In addition, Dapr runs natively on Kubernetes using an Operator and uses Helm as the main deployment mechanism.

Having been submitted in March 2021 to the CNCF, Dapr now joins the foundation in order to better integrate with the ecosystem, attract new developers and bring the Dapr community to the CNCF for the benefit of all projects. This is an exciting journey and we are certain that Dapr will bring even more developer focus to the CNCF.
