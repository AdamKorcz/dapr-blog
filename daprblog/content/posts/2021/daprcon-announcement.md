As the second anniversary of Dapr approaches, it is a great time for the community to come together for the inaugural DaprCon on **October 19th, 2021**! October is a special month for Dapr, as it was in October 2019 that [Dapr was officially announced](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/10/16/announcing-dapr-open-source-project-build-microservice-applications/). 

DaprCon will offer opportunities to speak to [Yaron Schneider](https://github.com/yaron2), [Mark Fussell](https://github.com/msfussell), and other co-founders and maintainers of the Dapr project.
Hear from several companies from across the globe who have integrated Dapr into their solutions. Use their stories as inspiration and see how Dapr can have a positive impact on your cloud native development.

DaprCon will be a virtual event allowing everyone to join from the comfort of their home or office. No need to register because it will be wide open for anyone to participate. Spend half a day with others who are excited to learn about the power that Dapr brings to your developers. 

No matter what language you program in, or platform you target, Dapr adds value to your application. At DaprCon you will get to see it in action. 

We'll share more details on this blog about the event's agenda, sessions and speakers in the next few weeks.

Stay tuned!
