It's a wrap! The first ever DaprCon had concluded yesterday and what an event it has been! 

The first day was kicked off with a keynote that gave us a bit of insight into Dapr's history, a peek into where it is going and some perspectives from key figures at *Microsoft*, *Alibaba Cloud* and *Intel*. We then got a to see how to go "from zero to hero" with Dapr, met some of the Dapr maintainers and learned about *Man Group*'s journey to adopt Dapr. We also got useful guidance on how to run Dapr in production and learned from the firsthand experience of enterprise adopters (*Zeiss*, *Bosch*, *Ignition Group* and *Man Group*) who have built real-world solutions with Dapr. Finally, the day concluded with another case study of Dapr adoption by *Legentic*.

On the second day, it was time to get our hands dirty and learn Dapr by coding through a set of assignments in a Dapr workshop! Available in C#, Python and Java these assignments were shown on the stream while DaprCon attendees were invited to try it on their own dev boxes, getting support and guidance on workshop dedicated [Discord](https://aka.ms/dapr-discord) channels.

Throughout both days it was great to see the Dapr community come together and engage over the live stream chat and on Discord with great questions and discussions. It was also great to see some new community members join us, discovering Dapr for the first time. To all of you we say - Welcome to the Dapr community!
