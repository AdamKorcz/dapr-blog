We are excited to announce the [release of Dapr v1.2](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.2.0)!

This is the second minor version update since the [announcement of Dapr v1.0]({{<ref v1-announcement>}}).

## Release highlights

If you're new to Dapr, visit the [getting started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) page and familiarize yourself with Dapr.

 - Support for **Pub/Sub event without CloudEvent wrapping**, enabling communication between Dapr and non-Dapr applications [(#2308)](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2308). This enables Dapr to send and receive events to integrate with applications that cannot use CloudEvents. See [Pub/Sub without CloudEvents](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/pubsub-raw/) documentation for details.
 - **Ability to scope the APIs that are available on Dapr sidecar** through ACLs [(#3054)](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/3054). For example, if you want to restrict access to only the secrets API from the applications, you can set ACLs on its access.  See [How-To: Selectively enable Dapr APIs on the Dapr sidecar](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/configuration/api-allowlist/) documentation for details.
 - Ability to **"opt-in" to preview features** that are included in  releases. This provides a way to introduce new features that still need feedback before being made GA in quality. Equally expect that preview features from previous releases (currently none) can be removed without a deprecation notice. [(#3048)](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/3048). See [How-To: Enable preview features](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/configuration/preview-features/) documentation for details.
 -  In this release **Actor Re-entrancy** [(#21)](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/21) is included as a *opt-in preview feature* for Actors. Reentrancy enables actor A to call actor B which can then call actor A again without the call blocking. See [How-to: Enable and use actor reentrancy in Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/actors/actor-reentrancy/) documentation for details.
 -  **Consul as a DNS name resolution component** [(#749)](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/749) enables Dapr to preform service discovery and use the service invocation API in VM scenarios that can be joined in the same network. This means that Dapr now supports Kubernetes,VMs and physical machines as production hosting enviroments with DNS resolution enabled in each. See [HashiCorp Consul component spec](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-name-resolution/setup-nr-consul/) documentation for details.
 -  As a result of the Consul intergration **Name resolution components are now first class component types** that can be "swapped" in the same manner as any other component type through Dapr configuration settings. See [Name resolution component specs](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-name-resolution/) documentation for details.   
 - Many **new components**:
     - Alibaba Cloud DingTalk Webhook as Binding [(#811)](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/811)
     - Zeebe Workflow Engine as Binding [(#805)](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/805)
     - Alibaba Sentinel as Middleware [(#828)](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/828)
     - Consul name resolution component [(#749)](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/749)
