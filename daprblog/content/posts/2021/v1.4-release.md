We are excited to announce the [release of Dapr v1.4](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.4.0)!

This is the fourth minor version update since the [announcement of Dapr v1.0]({{<ref v1-announcement>}}).

## Release highlights
If youâ€™re new to Dapr, familiarize yourself by visiting the [getting started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) page.

### State management
- **Added automatic encryption of data with support for key rotation ([preview feature](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-preview-features))** [#1090](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/1090). Enable automatic data-at-rest encryption of your state with support for bringing-your-own-key and key rotation. Supports all Dapr state stores. For more info, see the [docs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-encrypt-state/).

### Pub/Sub
- **Added content based routing for CloudEvents ([preview feature](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-preview-features))** [#2582](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2582). Enable pub/sub subscribers to perform message routing based on expressions applied to CloudEvents fields. For more info, see the [docs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/howto-route-messages/).

### Service invocation
- **Added new URL paths for HTTP service invocation** [#3546](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/3546). To make it easier to incrementally adopt Dapr into existing apps, the service invocation HTTP API now accepts additional URL formats. For more info, see the [docs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/howto-invoke-discover-services/#additional-url-formats).

### Bindings
- **Added the option to specify an HTTP endpoint route for input bindings** [#3520](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/3520). For more info, see the [docs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/bindings/howto-triggers/#specifying-a-custom-route).

### New components
  - [In memory Pub/Sub broker](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-inmemory/)
  - [JetStream Pub/Sub broker](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-jetstream/)
  - [Alibaba Cloud Tablestore binding](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/alicloudtablestore/)

## Release notes
See a detailed description of changes, fixes and new features in the [Dapr v1.4 release notes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

This release contains a few [breaking changes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/master/docs/release_notes/v1.4.0.md#breaking-changes).

## Supported releases   
Dapr supports two (2) prior versions from the current release. 

This means that there is a rolling window that moves forward for supported releases and it is your operational responsibility to remain up to date with these supported versions. If you have an older version of Dapr you may have to do intermediate upgrades to get to a supported version.

Since this release marks v1.4.0, the two prior supported versions are v1.2.0 and v1.3.0. 

Please visit the [Dapr Documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-release-policy/) for more information on supported releases.
