We are excited to announce the [release of Dapr v1.5](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.5.0)! 

This is the fifth minor version update since the [announcement of Dapr v1.0]({{<ref v1-announcement>}}). 

## Release highlights

If youâ€™re new to Dapr, familiarize yourself by visiting the [getting started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) page.

### Components upgraded to Stable
The Steering and Technical Committee [voted](https://github.com/dapr/community/issues/99) to rename the terminology for components certification from GA to Stable.

The following components upgraded to Stable:
- Kafka Pub/sub
- Azure KeyVault Secret store
- Azure SQL Server State store

For more information see the [Dapr components reference](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/).

### Simple Queries over State stores Preview
State Store APIs now include a Query API in Preview status. The Query API provides a way of querying the key/value data stored in state store components. This query API is not a replacement for a complete query language, and is focused on retrieving, filtering and sorting key/value data that you have saved through the state management APIs.

Even though the state store is a key/value store, the value might be a JSON document with its own hierarchy, keys, and values. The query API allows you to use those keys and values to retrieve corresponding documents.

For more information see [Query API docs](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-state-query-api/). 

### Actors in the Go SDK
Actors APIs are now available in the Dapr SDK for Go. There are also several improvements to the runtime that improve reliability.

See [go-sdk/21](https://github.com/dapr/go-sdk/issues/21), [dapr/1914](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/1914), and [dapr/3533](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/3533 ) for details.

### Configuration API 
`TODO`

## Release notes
See a detailed description of changes, fixes and new features in the [Dapr v1.5 release notes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

This release contains a few [breaking changes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/release-1.4/docs/release_notes/v1.4.0.md#Breaking-Changes).

## Supported releases   
Dapr supports two (2) prior versions from the current release. 

This means that there is a rolling window that moves forward for supported releases and it is your operational responsibility to remain up to date with these supported versions. If you have an older version of Dapr you may have to do intermediate upgrades to get to a supported version.

Since this release marks v1.5.0, the two prior supported versions are v1.3.0 and v1.4.0. 

Please visit the [Dapr Documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-release-policy/) for more information on supported releases.
