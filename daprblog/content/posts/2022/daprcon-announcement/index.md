Come celebrate [the third anniversary of Dapr](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/10/16/announcing-dapr-open-source-project-build-microservice-applications/) at the second annual DaprCon on ðŸŽ‰ **October 25th, 2022**! ðŸŽ‰ This year, as an incubating CNCF project, DaprCon will be hosted as a community day event during KubeCon NA: the same great event to share alongside a larger community!

This year, DaprCon will be a hybrid event allowing everyone to join either in-person at KubeCon or from the comfort of their home or office.

| **When** | October 25, 2022 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST |
| **Where** | Detroit, MI |
| **Cost** | Registration for DaprCon is _free_. |

DaprCon will offer opportunities to:

- Hear stories and experiences from companies who have integrated Dapr into their solutions.
- Participate in hands-on Dapr technical sessions â€“ code with us or just sit-in and listen.
- Speak to Dapr project maintainers, co-founders and contributors.
- Participate in our end-user panels for Dapr questions on their real scenarios and architectures.
- Discuss stories, learnings, and best practices for Dapr and how it can positively impact cloud native development.

No matter what language you program in, platform you target, or architecture setup you leverage, Dapr adds value to your application. Join the community at DaprCon 2022 and stop by during KubeCon to see Dapr in action. 

We'll share more details on this blog about the event's agenda, sessions, and speakers in the next few weeks.

Stay tuned!
