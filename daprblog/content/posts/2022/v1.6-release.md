## Release notes
See a detailed description of changes, fixes and new features in the [Dapr v1.6 release notes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.6.0).

This release contains [breaking changes and deprecations](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/release-1.6/docs/release_notes/v1.6.0.md#breaking-changes--deprecations).

## Supported releases   
Dapr supports two (2) prior versions from the current release. 

This means that there is a rolling window that moves forward for supported releases and it is your operational responsibility to remain up to date with these supported versions. If you have an older version of Dapr you may have to do intermediate upgrades to get to a supported version.

Since this release marks v1.6.0, the two prior supported versions are v1.4.0 and v1.5.0. 

Visit the [Dapr Documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-release-policy/) for more information on supported releases.
